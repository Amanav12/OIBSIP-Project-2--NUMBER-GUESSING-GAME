Project Title: Number Guessing Game
Project Overview:
The Number Guessing Game is a simple and engaging Java console application where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on whether the player's guess is too high or too low, and tracks the number of attempts. The application also includes a scoreboard to display the player's best performance.

Scoreboard:
